<h style="font-size:60px;">RESEARCH SCIENTIST </h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
A research scientist plans and performs experiments in a wide range of areas, from medical research to natural sciences to computer science and much more. Research scientists work in many different kinds of organizations, including government agencies, universities and private businesses. Scientists often work in teams, but can also conduct research on their own.Research scientists are responsible for the investigation of deficits within scientific knowledge. They devise, formulate, and execute investigative protocols and disseminate their insights through the publishing of findings in authoritative publications and documents. They are responsible for securing sufficient and pertinent funding to supplement finances, and they conduct in-house research and presentations; they spearhead data collection and interpretation and work as co-chairs for joint research undertakings.</p>
<h style="font-size:40px;">How To Become a Research Scientist</h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">If you're interested in becoming a research scientist, one of the first things to consider is how much education you need. We've determined that 51.7% of research scientists have a bachelor's degree. In terms of higher education levels, we found that 19.7% of research scientists have master's degrees. Even though most research scientists have a college degree, it's impossible to become one with only a high school degree or GED.</p>
<h style="font-size:40px;">	What does a research scientist do?</h><br>
<ul style="font-size:25px;"> 
Research scientists conduct laboratory-based experiments and trials. You can find them in a variety of different fields, including medicine, political science, biology, chemistry, computer science and environmental science. Some of their primary responsibilities include:
<li>Planning and conducting experiments</li>
<li>Writing research papers and reports</li>
<li>Collecting samples and carrying out other types of fieldwork</li>
<li>Monitoring experiments and recording and analyzing data</li>
<li>Supervising junior staff members</li>
<li>Demonstrating procedures</li>
<li>Staying up-to-date on the newest developments in scientific research</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
<h style="font-size:40px;">What skills should research scientists have?</h><br>
There are many skills that can help a research scientist succeed in their role. Some of the most important skills include:<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Communication</h><br>
Research scientists must have strong verbal communication skills to articulate their observations to other scientists and technicians in a laboratory. They must also have strong writing skills to successfully write grant proposals to pursue funding for their research or write summaries and reports with their findings. Many research scientists publish the results of their work in journals.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Data analysis</h><br>
Research scientists must be able to conduct experiments and research, gather information and analyze that information to reach a conclusion.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Critical thinking</h><br>
To solve a specific problem, research scientists must first use their critical thinking skills to determine the best method for exploring the problem and conducting an interview.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Interpersonal skills</h><br>
Research scientists must be able to work well with other team members, including other research scientists, technicians and staff members. Interpersonal skills like listening, speaking and questioning skills ensure strong working relationships and effective teamwork.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Patience</h><br>
It can take a long time to see results in an experiment. Research scientists must have the patience to stay optimistic throughout the course of their research.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Strong attention to detail</h><br>
To record information accurately and design repeatable procedures, research scientists must have strong attention to detail.

<h style="font-size:40px;">Types of Scientists</h><br>
Science-related knowledge and skills are necessary for a wide range of vocations and careers, from research to industry to regulation to teaching<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Business Scientist</h><br>The Business Scientist supports evidence-based decision-making within businesses and other enterprises by supporting strong management and business abilities with scientific understanding. This kind of scientist is confident in a corporate setting and possesses the scientific and technical expertise necessary to be credible with both coworkers and rivals. They can be found in a wide range of positions in scientific and technology firms, from R&D to marketing to the C-suite itself.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Communicator Scientist</h><br>The Communicator Scientist blends communication skills with knowledge of science and technology. Through empathy and a grasp of the audience’s requirements, knowledge of how media and other communication channels function, and, of course, a thorough understanding of the science involved, they inspire, inform, and effectively communicate their message.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Developer Scientist</h><br>The developer scientist, also known as a translational scientist, turns previously unusable knowledge into something that society can benefit from. They might be creating new goods or services, concepts that alter behaviour, advancements in medical treatment and medication, or the use of current technology in novel contexts.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Entrepreneur Scientist</h><br> Innovation is produced by the entrepreneur scientist. Their contacts and scientific understanding go far enough to enable them to recognise chances for innovation not just in the private sector but also in the public sector and other facets of society. They build their own enterprises or work to expand established ones by fusing their expertise in science with great commercial and financial acumen, people-management abilities, and entrepreneurial spirit.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Explorer Scientist</h><br>Like the crew of the Enterprise, the Explorer Scientist is on a voyage of exploration “to boldly explore where no one has gone before.” They rarely concentrate on a particular result or effect; instead, they seek to learn the next piece of the puzzle of scientific knowledge and understanding. They are more likely to be seen working alone in a research facility, university, or company’s Research & Development (R&D).<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Investigator Scientist</h><br> The Investigator Scientist explores the uncharted by observing, outlining, comprehending, and putting together in-depth knowledge and data, laying the groundwork for subsequent interpreters and developers. They are most likely to be found working as a team in a multidisciplinary setting at a university or research facility, or in research and development (R&D) at an organisation.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Policy Scientist</h><br>To make sure that law and policy have a solid evidence base, the policy scientist employs their expertise in science, technology, and government and policy making. Some policy scientists identify as a combination of 75% scientists and 25% politicians. This kind of scientist is employed and active in a variety of settings, including government and parliament, NGOs, advocacy organisations, and charities.<br>
<h style="font-size:40px;">Technician Scientist</h><br>The Technician Scientist offers a variety of operational scientific services. These are the scientists who work in forensic science, food science, health and safety, materials analysis and testing, education, and many more fields where we have grown to rely on them. This kind of scientist, which is rarely seen, is present in many different types of support service environments such as labs.<br>
