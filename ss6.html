<h style="font-size:35px;">What Is a Financial Analyst?</h>
<br>
Financial analysts examine financial data and use their findings to help companies make business decisions. Often, their analysis is meant to inform the investing decisions of companies.
More specifically, financial analysts research macroeconomic and microeconomic conditions along with company fundamentals to make predictions about businesses, sectors, and industries. They also often recommend a course of action, such as buying or selling a company's stock based on its overall performance and outlook.
<br>
An analyst must be aware of current developments in the field in which they specialize, as well as in preparing financial models to predict future economic conditions for any number of variables.
Not all financial analysts analyze the stock or bond markets or help their employers make investments. Companies may also hire an analyst to use numerical data to pinpoint the efficacy of various marketing techniques relative to cost. Businesses that utilize the franchise model often have financial analysts who are responsible for tracking individual franchises or groups of franchises within a geographic region. The analysts determine where the strengths and weaknesses lie and make profit and loss forecasts.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Required Skills and Education<br></h>

Compared to many high-paying careers, the qualifications to become a financial analyst are much less rigid and well-defined. Unlike law and medicine, no career-wide educational minimums exist. Whether you face any required licensing depends on factors, such as your employer and your specific job duties.
<br>
That said, in the 21st century, a bachelor's degree—preferably with a major in economics, finance, or statistics—has become a de facto requirement for becoming a financial analyst. Other majors that are looked upon favorably include accounting and math, and even biology and engineering—especially if one has an interest in specializing as an analyst in those industries. The competition is too great, and undergraduate or advanced degrees are too common in the job market, to have a serious chance of applying for an analyst position with less than a bachelor's degree.
<br>
The big investment banks, where the huge first-year salaries get paid, recruit almost exclusively at elite colleges and universities, such as Harvard University and Princeton University. Candidates applying with degrees from less prestigious schools can increase their chances by continuing their education and obtaining an MBA from a highly-ranked business school. MBA graduates are often hired as senior analysts right out of business school.
<br>
Regardless of education, a successful career as a financial analyst requires strong quantitative skills, expert problem-solving abilities, adeptness in the use of logic, and above-average communication skills. Financial analysts have to crunch data, but they also have to report their findings to their superiors in a clear, concise, and persuasive manner.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Financial Analyst Salaries and Demand</h>
<br>
As a range of diverse, new financial products becomes available on a global scale, every industry and market faces new challenges. In most cases, businesses will require the services of financial analysts who have up-to-date knowledge and relevant expertise.
According to Forbes, in 2017, financial analyst became the most promising job in the finance sector. This appears to be a trend, as BLS has projected an 11-percent growth in the employment of financial analysts between 2016 and 2026.
<br>
While markets and economic factors can shift over time, the strong demand and above-average growth potential for financial analysts seem to indicate good earning potential for students who choose to pursue this profession. BLS reports that the median salary of a typical financial analyst is $84,300. However, salary can vary by industry. Financial analysts who work in securities, commodity contracts, and other financial investments and related activities can earn a higher median salary of $100,180 while analysts working for insurance carriers and related activities may earn a lower median salary of $76,860. Entry-level financial analysts with under five years of experience may also have an initial lower annual salary, which starts at $57,000 according to PayScale.
