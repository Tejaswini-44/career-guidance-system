Before knowing the CA course details after 12th in detail, let us first polish our knowledge by quickly understanding who is a CA. A Chartered Accountant or CA is a person who has a career as a financial controller in business companies and other sectors. The top different positions acquired by a CA include:
<br>
<ul style="font-size:25px;">
<li>Tax Accountant</li>
<li>Management Accountant</li>
<li>Financial Accountant</li>
<li>Financial Analyst</li>
<li>Budget Analyst</li>
<li>Auditor, and more</li>

<br>
CA is divided into 3 levels along with 3 years of practical training which requires approx. 4.5 years after class 12th. One can become a CA after class 12th or graduation. The candidates must clear three levels of examinations conducted by ICAI.
Chartered accountancy or accountancy essentially means the same. The profession involves management of finances for an entity. This includes managing financial accounts, budgeting, auditing, business strategy and taxation.
<br>
The difference between an accountant and a chartered accountant is that the latter has taken an in-depth training of years and has passed multiple exams in various aspects of accounting to earn the title of a chartered accountant.
<br>
