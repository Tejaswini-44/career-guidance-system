<h style="font-size:60px;"> PHYSICIST </h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
Physicists are scientists whose study research constitutes everything that exists physically starting from tiny gadgets to missing stars.  Physicists study matter and energy and how to apply the knowledge in order to solve scientific and other technological issues.
<br>
Physicists can work at various government and private academic institutes, laboratories, and research institutes. If they do not want to work as a physicist, then they can work as a scientist, academic researcher, Astronomer, Geophysicist, Nanotechnologist, Meteorologist, Metallurgist, etc. There are various Types of Physicist based on their specialization and area of work, such as Theoritical Physicist, Experimental Physicist and Applied Physicist.
There are several Benefits of Becoming a Physicist such as high salary package, innumerable job opprtunities, shaping a positive career etc. Some of the key skills that are essential to become a Physicist are Mathematical Knowledge, Scientific Reasoning, Technical Knowledge etc.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Steps to become a Physicist</h><br>
The work of a physicist is to conduct measurements, experiments, and mathematical analysis to formulate physical laws that control space, time, energy, and matter. They either do theoretical analysis or carry out experimental research.
To pursue a career as a physicist, a candidate should hold a postgraduate degree or a doctorate degree in Physics. This will allow them to find jobs at various research centers.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Eligibility Criteria</h><br>
<ul style="font-size:25px;">
To pursue a career as a physicist the candidates should fulfill the following:
<li>The candidates should have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics in 10+2.</li>
<li>They should have completed a minimum of 3 years of bachelor's degree in disciplines of Physics, Applied Physics, or Mathematics.</li>
<li>They should have completed a postgraduate program, usually an MSc in Physics with a specialization of their choice.</li>
<li>Some of the job requirements require a doctorate degree (M.Phil/Ph.D.) in Physics.</li>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Types of Physicists</h><br>
Physicists can be categorized into 3 types. All these types have been mentioned below:
<br>
<li>Theoretical Physicists - They create theories and models to explain the behavior of specific aspects of the world.</li>
<li>Experimental Physicists - They test the theories and models of the theoretical physicist to verify their claims and recommend improvements.</li>
<li>Applied Physicists - They apply the research of the physicist to solve problems in the field of technology, science, and society.</li>

<h style="font-size:35px;">Physicist Courses</h> 
<br>
BSc Physics, MSc Physics and PhD in Physics are the three courses that would help become a Physicist. Mentioned below are the eligibility details and other prerequisites for becoming a Physicist. 
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">BSc Physics</h>
<br>
BSc Physics is an undergraduate program of 3 years that deals with theory and experimental courses mainly from physics and interdisciplinary courses like mathematics, chemistry, and computer science.
<li>The admission into the BSc Physics course is either based on the entrance examination or based on the previous academic scores.</li> 
<li>There is no such common entrance exam conducted for admission into BSc Physics. The institutes usually conduct their own exams.</li>
<li>DUET is one of the exams the candidates can appear for. It offers admission into various institutes affiliated with Delhi University.</li> 
<li>Candidates should have completed their 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics and have a minimum aggregate of 50% in 10+2.</li>
<h style="font-size:35px;">MSc Physics</h><br>
MSc Physics is a 2-year postgraduate program that involves an in-depth study of nature for understanding the behavior of the universe.
The admission into the course is usually based on the entrance examination. 
<li>There are various entrance exams where the candidates can appear for admission into MSc Physics. Some of such exams are BHU PET, JNUEE, DUET, IPU CET, etc.</li>
<li>To appear for the BHU-PET exam, candidates should have completed BSc with a minimum aggregate of 50% from a recognized university.</li>
<li>The reserved category and physically challenged candidates are provided with a relaxation of 5%.</li>
<li>The applicant should be Indian and there is no age limit.</li>
<h style="font-size:35px;">PhD Physics</h><br>
<li>It is a 3-year doctorate program in the field of physics. This course allows candidates to conduct research in any area of physics.</li>
<li>The candidates who have cleared exams like JEST, NET, etc are eligible to apply for the Ph.D. program.</li>
<li>The final selection will be based on factors like scores in the exam, personal interview, previous academic records, research topic, etc.</li>
<h style="font-size:35px;">Benefits of Becoming a Physicist</h><br>
A physicist as a profession can be beneficial in several ways. Some of the benefits of being a physicist has been explained below:
<li>Salary: A physicist can earn around INR 65,300 per month in India. The salary could vary drastically based on skills, experience, gender, location, etc. The lowest salary a physicist can expect is around INR 32,700 and the highest could be around INR 1,01,000 per annum.</li>
<li>Job Security: The jobs in government sectors usually provide job security, but the private institutions do not guarantee such job securities. Government jobs are offered after clearing the entrance exams and the interview. Some of the job positions are on a contract basis but in most cases, the jobs are secured till the person is retired. Also, they are offered a pension after retirement.</li>
<li>Positive Impact of the Career: The demand for physicists is huge since the world needs innovation in every sector and physicists are the ones who build theories and discoveries that would lead to those innovations. Physics is a broad subject and physicists usually specialize in a specific area. Though they have a broader area to choose from. They will be able to work as researchers or scientists in academic institutes, research centers, and laboratories. Physicists with a doctorate degree can also work as a professor at the academic institutes.</li>
<li>Higher Studies: Higher studies mean better knowledge and better skills. The salary also increases with higher education. With a master's degree, an individual can earn around 38% more than a bachelor's degree. And with a doctorate degree, they can earn around 31% more than the master's degree.</li>
