<h style="font-size:60px;"> ACOUSTIC CONSULTANT </h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
An acoustical engineer is a professional who specializes in sound and vibration science (physics). Their main goal is to reduce noise and vibration that might affect people and enhance the acoustic environment for the general public. Environmental, architectural, industrial, entertainment, manufacturing, and transportation are just a few industries that benefit from acoustical engineering skills.

<h style="font-size:35px;">Acoustic Engineering Courses</h>
In a sound engineering course, students acquire technical information and how to put that knowledge into practice. The course encourages students to think critically and creatively about sound and music creation for various objectives. Sound Design, Automation, Music Theory, Ear Training, Audio Engineering, Studio Techniques, Audio Cables and Interconnections, The Power of Musical Instrument Digital Surface, Acoustics, Studio Designing, Recording or Microphone Techniques are only a few of the topics covered.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">1.Acoustical Engineering (MEng)</h>
<br>
Acoustics is a branch of science that studies the mechanics of sound and the psychology of how humans react to noise and vibration. With our MEng (Hons) Acoustical and Audio Engineering degree, you may prepare for a satisfying future job where you can make the world a better sounding place.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">2.Acoustics with Music (BSc)</h>
This challenging multidisciplinary degree will assist you in developing the scientific abilities and creative attitude necessary to build tomorrow’s music tools, places, and software. You’ll learn how contemporary technology transforms the way sound is made, altered, and transmitted.
<br>
<h style="font-size:35px;">3.BEng Acoustical Engineering</h>
This acoustical engineering course examines how acoustics, or the study of sound and vibration, is used in technology. It may be used for a variety of things, including:
<li>Automobile design</li>
<li>Concert venues are designed using 3D audio systems.</li>
<li>Aeroplane noise reduction</li>
<li>Ultrasound is being used to combat antibiotic resistance.</li>
