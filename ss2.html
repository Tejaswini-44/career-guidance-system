<h style="font-size:60px;"> DATA SCIENTIST </h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
Data Science is an integrative subject which uses many statistical methods, scientific algorithms, information science, data analysis, machine learning concepts, and other related subjects to extract knowledge from a large group of data – both structured and unstructured to produce a strategy for the companies to know about their data and its analysis. Data Scientists possess industry-specific knowledge along with an ace in technical and programming skills. They write highly complex algorithms to bring large amounts of data together. Depending upon the output given by a data scientist, a company plans its business strategy and its plans. Data Science is an emerging career option in the present age. With a steep rise in big data, the biggest high tech companies to medium-sized firms have opened up positions for data scientists to make future predictions about the business based upon the data. The demand is going to increase in the coming future.
A work routine of a Data Scientist revolves around data. They help the company make strong decisions and improve business strategy in the competitive market depending upon data analysis. They pull the data, merge it, and analyze the trends in the data using many tools such as Python, MATLAB, R, Tableau, Hadoop, SQL, and/or Excel. They write new algorithms based on the analysis and tests them in real-time.
<br>
After the job is done, Data Scientist will conduct important meetings with the clients and explain the data analysis and the science behind it to the non-technical people of different departments such as Sales, Marketing, and Planning, etc. The job of a Data Scientist is an indoor-based one. The work pressure may build up at times when the predictive models did not work as expected or when the code goes wrong. The job of a data scientist can be an individual as well as team-oriented work depending upon the size of the company, nature of the business, etc. An average work hour of a data scientist is up to 60 hours per week. There can be extensions in the work duration depending upon the nature of the business.
<br>
In an ever-growing industry of Data Science, the demand for employment is very high. This trend has been increasing in recent years. The most coveted roles in Data Science are Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, Business Analytics Manager, Data Engineer, Big Data Specialist and MIS Consultant/Data Visualization Consultant.
<br>
The average salary of an entry-level data scientist in India is around five to six lakh per annum. As the experience and skills increase, a person can expect from Rs 30 Lakh to Rs 50 Lakh per annum as the average salary. The salary can also depend upon the nature of the company you have been employed, the industry, etc.  The different types of specialization in Data Science are Data Mining, Statistical Analysis, Cloud and Distributed Computing, Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization and Presentation, and Artificial Intelligence. These are some areas where people can get their expertise and be viable to the ever-changing needs of the industry. 
Every role in Data Science offers the best growth. No role in Data Science is stagnant. It is an icing on the cake for the data scientist to enhance their knowledge and skills. they will be in constant demand by the majority of the companies.
<br>
As there are complex and unmanageable data in the companies, the future of a data scientist is wide and clear. There is a steep demand in Big data and the data privacy regulations are being changed, which creates more demand for data scientists. According to LinkedIn, Data Science is the most promising career of 2019. On average, a person may take seven years or more years to get established in the field of Data Science. This period can be shortened if the person has the required skills and is keen on learning new methods and technologies the job demands.
