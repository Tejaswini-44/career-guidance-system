<h style="font-size:60px;"> LAWYER </h>
<p style="font-size:25px;">
Lawyers are licensed professionals who study and practice law. A lawyer usually has a concentration area and a group of people or interests that they advocate for.
<br>
Lawyers apply the law to specific cases. They investigate the facts and the evidence by conferring with their clients and reviewing documents, and they prepare and file the pleadings in court. At the trial, they introduce evidence, interrogate witnesses, and argue questions of law and fact. If they do not win the case, they may seek a new trial or relief in an appellate court.
<br>
Lawyers have several loyalties in their work, including loyalties to their clients, to the administration of justice, to the community, to their associates in practice, and to themselves. When these loyalties conflict, the standards of the profession are intended to effect a reconciliation.
